# PHYS-375-Gravity-Group
This is the repository for the PHYS 375 group project where we will be modifying gravity.

This group will modify gravity in a specific way and infer the limits that may be placed on the modification length scale given that the Main Sequence is known to better than 10%. While many potential modifications of gravity may be considered, we will consider only one simple possible change: Below some scale 位 we imagine that the gravitational force has a component that scales as r^-3.
The goal is then to constrain 位. Note that 位 can be both positive and negative, and in this case will produce a linear cusp of one sort or another at the center of the star. The group should generate a variety of main sequences as functions of 位 and explore the implications for the HR diagram, and the L-M and M-R relations.
